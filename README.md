# Bike Rental Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of bike rent counts against different features to understand the factors influencing bike rentals. The dataset used in this project contains daily bike rental counts along with various features such as date, season, weather conditions, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `day.csv`, which includes the following columns:

- `instant`: Record index
- `dteday`: Date
- `season`: Season (1: winter, 2: spring, 3: summer, 4: fall)
- `yr`: Year (0: 2018, 1: 2019)
- `mnth`: Month (1 to 12)
- `holiday`: Whether the day is a holiday or not (1: holiday, 0: not a holiday)
- `weekday`: Day of the week (0 to 6)
- `workingday`: Whether the day is a working day or not (1: working day, 0: not a working day)
- `weathersit`: Weather situation (1: clear, 2: mist, 3: light snow/rain, 4: heavy rain/snow)
- `temp`: Normalized temperature in Celsius
- `atemp`: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
- `hum`: Normalized humidity
- `windspeed`: Normalized wind speed
- `casual`: Count of casual users
- `registered`: Count of registered users
- `cnt`: Total count of bike rentals (casual + registered)

## Analysis

The analysis performed in this project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting any inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualization of bike rental counts over time.
   - Analysis of bike rental counts against different features such as season, weather conditions, and weekday.
   - Correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between features and bike rental counts.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve the analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Building predictive models to forecast bike rental counts based on the features.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - Load the dataset using pandas: `df = pd.read_csv('day.csv')`
   - Follow the steps in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis include insights into how different features affect bike rental counts, as well as the performance of predictive models in forecasting bike rentals.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bike rental data, revealing important factors that influence bike rentals. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to improve bike rental services and enhance user experience.
